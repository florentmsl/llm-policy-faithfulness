Reference example (analysis style only):
Interpret the policy logic and describe behavior. Do not infer hidden objectives beyond the code.

Policy:
```python
def play(state):
    if state["D(Ball, Paddle).y"] > 2:
        return 2  # DOWN
    if state["D(Ball, Paddle).y"] < -2:
        return 1  # UP
    return 0  # NOOP
```

Behavior explanation:
This policy tracks the vertical offset between the ball and the controlled paddle.
If the ball is below the paddle, it moves down; if the ball is above, it moves up.
When the offset is small, it does nothing and keeps the paddle near its current position.
The behavior is reactive tracking, not strategic planning.
