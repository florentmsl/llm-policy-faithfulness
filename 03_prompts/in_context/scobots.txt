Policy:
```python
def play(state):
    if state["D(Ball, Paddle).y"] > 2:
        return 2  # DOWN
    if state["D(Ball, Paddle).y"] < -2:
        return 1  # UP
    return 0  # NOOP
```

Execution trace example:
Trace in execution order:
- Evaluate conditions from top to bottom.
- At each branch, mark true/false explicitly.
- Stop at the first `return` reached.
- Describe only what the executed path shows.

Worked traces:
- Input: `D(Ball, Paddle).y = 5`
  - Check `> 2` -> true
  - First reached return: `2` (DOWN)
- Input: `D(Ball, Paddle).y = -4`
  - Check `> 2` -> false
  - Check `< -2` -> true
  - First reached return: `1` (UP)
- Input: `D(Ball, Paddle).y = 0`
  - Check `> 2` -> false
  - Check `< -2` -> false
  - Fall through to final return: `0` (NOOP)
