Here is the symbolic policy:
```python
def play(state):
    if state["ED(Chicken1, Car1)"] <= 2:
        return 0  # NOOP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] > 0:
        return 1  # UP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] < 0:
        return 2  # DOWN
    return 0  # NOOP
```

Question:
Is this policy actually working for the stated task? Explain in plain language.

Answer rules:
- Ground your explanation in the policy conditions/actions.
- End with exactly one final line: `VERDICT: YES` or `VERDICT: NO`.
