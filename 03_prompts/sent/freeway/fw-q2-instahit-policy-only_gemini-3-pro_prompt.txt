You need to help a user analyze a control policy for a reinforcement learning task.
The policy is obtained with deep reinforcement learning.
You need to first understand the goal of the task and the policy.

# Task Description

# The Policy
Here is the symbolic policy obtained after training:
```python
def play(state):
    if state["ED(Chicken1, Car1)"] <= 2:
        return 0  # NOOP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] > 0:
        return 1  # UP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] < 0:
        return 2  # DOWN
    return 0  # NOOP
```

# Example (only for reference)

# Your Task
Describe what this policy is doing, use plain language.

# Answer Rules
- The explanation must be specific and concrete.
- Trace the program flow in execution order (which conditions are checked, which branches are taken, and which actions are returned).
- Your explanations should be entirely based on the policy.
