Here is the symbolic policy:
```python
def play(state):
    if state["ED(Chicken1, Car1)"] <= 2:
        return 0  # NOOP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] > 0:
        return 1  # UP
    if state["D(Chicken1, Car1).y"] < 0:
        return 2  # DOWN
    return 0  # NOOP
```

Question:
Describe what this policy is actually doing, use plain language.

Answer rules:
- Focus on behavior implied by policy conditions/actions.
- Keep the description short and concrete.
