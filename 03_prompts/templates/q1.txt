Here is the symbolic policy that we obtained after training:
```python
{{SYMBOLIC_POLICY}}
```

{{COT_INSTRUCTION}}

Question:
Is this policy actually working for the stated task?

Answer requirements:
- Explain the concrete behavior implied by the policy conditions and returned actions.
- Do not assume success from "trained"; rely only on the policy and provided context.
- End with exactly one final line: `VERDICT: YES` or `VERDICT: NO`.
