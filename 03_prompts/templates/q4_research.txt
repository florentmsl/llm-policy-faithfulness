You need to help a user analyze a control policy for a reinforcement learning task.
The policy is obtained with deep reinforcement learning.
You need to first understand the goal of the task and the policy.

# The Policy
Here is the symbolic policy obtained after training:
```python
{{SYMBOLIC_POLICY}}
```

{{#IN_CONTEXT_LEARNING_EXAMPLE}}
# Example (only for reference)
Here is an example of how to analyze and explain a symbolic policy (only for reference):
{{IN_CONTEXT_LEARNING_EXAMPLE}}
{{/IN_CONTEXT_LEARNING_EXAMPLE}}

# Your Task
Predict how this exact policy's behavior changes under the simplification. Explain in plain language.

Clarification:
- "Simplification" means a change to the environment dynamics/conditions, not a simpler policy.
- The symbolic policy stays exactly the same; only the environment changes.

# Answer Rules
- The explanation must be specific and concrete.
- Trace the program flow in execution order (which conditions are checked, which branches are taken, and which actions are returned).
- Your explanations should be entirely based on the policy.
- First describe expected behavior in the baseline setup.
- Then describe expected behavior in the simplified setup.
- Explain the behavioral change by linking it to concrete policy conditions/actions.
