Based on a review of the provided code, this policy does not actually work for playing the game.

Here's why:
While the policy contains a large, complex decision tree that checks numerous conditions—such as the distances (`ED`, `D`) and relative positions (`LT`, `C`) between the chicken and various cars—**every single branch of the `if/else` statements returns the exact same value: `1`.** Even though the comments label the outputs differently (e.g., `# UP`, `# DOWN`, `# NOOP`), the actual integer returned to the game environment is always `1` regardless of the state. Because it continuously outputs a single, constant action without adapting to the changing positions of the cars, the policy will fail to dodge obstacles or navigate the environment successfully.

`VERDICT: NO`
