## Baseline (normal Freeway with moving cars)

### What the policy actually does
If you follow the code in execution order, it *looks* like a big decision tree—but every leaf returns the same action:

- Start: check `state['LT(Chicken1, Car1).x'] <= 0`
  - If **true**, enter the first big branch, which checks dozens of other conditions…
    - No matter which sub-conditions are true/false, every reachable leaf ends with `return 1`.
  - If **false**, enter the `else` branch, which also checks dozens of other conditions…
    - Again, every reachable leaf ends with `return 1`.

So the policy is behaviorally equivalent to:

```python
def play(state):
    return 1
```

Given your example mapping (`1  # UP`), this means the chicken **always presses UP**, and *none* of the state predicates actually change the action (even where the comment says `# DOWN` or `# NOOP`, the code still returns `1`).

### Expected baseline behavior
- The chicken will continuously try to move upward every step, regardless of where cars are.
- Because cars move horizontally and the policy never waits or backs up, it will **walk into traffic frequently**, getting hit and knocked back/reset depending on difficulty.
- It may still occasionally make progress (e.g., by repeatedly pushing up and eventually slipping through), but it will not exhibit “timing/anticipation” behavior—just constant upward motion.

## Simplified setup (all cars immobilized)

### Program-flow trace under simplification
The checked conditions still depend on car/chicken positions, but since *every* path returns `1`, immobilizing cars does not change which action is produced:
- Same first check `LT(Chicken1, Car1).x <= 0` → either way → eventually `return 1`.

### Expected simplified behavior (behavioral change)
- Since cars no longer move, the reason the baseline fails (needing to time gaps / avoid oncoming vehicles) disappears.
- With the policy still always outputting `1` (UP), the chicken will **march straight upward and keep doing so**, so it should **cross much more reliably and repeatedly**, yielding a much higher score than in the baseline.

In short: the simplification doesn’t change the policy’s decision-making (it has none—always `1`), but it changes the environment so that “always UP” becomes far more effective.
